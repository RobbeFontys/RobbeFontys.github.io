# Portfolio Website

Hey there! 👋 I'm Robbe, and this is my personal portfolio website where I showcase my work as a UI/UX designer. I built this site to share my design journey, projects, and connect with fellow creatives and potential collaborators.

## What's This All About?

This portfolio is more than just a collection of my work – it's a reflection of my design philosophy and professional journey. I've focused on creating an experience that's not just visually appealing but also tells a story about who I am as a designer.

## ✨ Key Features

- **Modern, Clean Design**: A minimalist aesthetic that puts the focus on the work
- **Responsive Layout**: Looks great on everything from mobile to desktop
- **Smooth Animations**: Subtle interactions that make the site feel alive
- **Project Showcase**: Detailed case studies of my work
- **Contact Form**: Easy way to get in touch
- **Custom Cursor**: A unique interactive element that adds personality

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

I kept things simple and performant:
- HTML5
- CSS3 (with modern features like Grid and Flexbox)
- Vanilla JavaScript
- Google Fonts (Inter and Space Grotesk)

## 🚀 Getting Started
